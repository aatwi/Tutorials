# Developer's Tutorial Repository
  
Programming topics are best perceived by developers through code! Thus, all technical
articles include code snippets for demoing the problem and solution. This is a great
feature, but, in my opinion, it is not enough! 
   
The purpose of this repository is to accumulate all the code for the technical 
articles I write on my personal [blog post](https://ahmadatwi.me/). 

# Sub Modules  
## [Spring JPA Testing](spring-jpa-testing/README.md)
In this project, I demonstrate testing the repository layer in a Spring Application
without using SpringBootTest that runs the Spring Framework for each test class.

The main purpose of this approach is to make the tests in our Spring Application 
run faster; thus, having a faster feedback loop.

Check my [blog post]() for further explanation of the problem!
